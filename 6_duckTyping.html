/*
	=============================================
	Javascript does not have the type matching which means you can pass anything and javascript will take it and 
	compile it at run time. this can cause many issues.

	For Example:  var employeeNames = []; You can push "John", Boolean , String, Object, 123 or even null, there is no stopping it.

	To solve this issue we can use instanceof method at some point but it will also fail if you have multiple inheritance scenario.  

	So what to do..  

	Check out below examples
*/

		return (method != null && this[method] != null && this[method] instanceof Function);
	}

	Object.prototype.isPropertyImplemented = function(property){
		return (property != null && this[property] != null && !this[property] instanceof Function);
	}


	class Person{		
		constructor(name, surname){
			this.name = name;
			this.surname = surname;

	class Developer{
		constructor(name, surname, knownLanguage){
			Person.apply(this, arguments);
			this.knownLanguage = knownLanguage;
		}

		writeCode(){
			console.log("Write code");
		}
	}

	class SoftwareComp{
		constructor(){
			this.employees = [];
		}

		hire(dev){
			if(dev.isMethodImplemented("writeCode")){
				this.employees.push(dev);
			}else{
				throw new Error("The Argument is not compatible with the required interface : name " + "writeCode");
			}
