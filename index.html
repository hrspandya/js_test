		Now to avoid using member methods and causing memory issue, we started using self invocking function and declared private 
		variables outside of the constructor this will create closure and seats will be accessible by all prototype methods even after 
		TheatreSeats3 done executing.

		IMPORTANT:  But since closure is making seats accessible by all objects, it creates a problem where seats is specific to perticular object. 

		For example: 
		as Shown above, countOccupiedSeats is returning 9 for t3_1 object, but when we create new object t3_2 then that also has countOccupiedSeats updated. which means seats is not being set per object, but for every object which defets the purpose of objects itself.
